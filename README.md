# Advent of Code Solutions in C++

Welcome to my respository of Advent of Code solutions. I started doing this in 2020 and have done all my solutions in c++.
No, I've never made it on the global leaderboard and likely never will.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a yearly event organized by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) in which a new two-part coding challenge is released at midnight EST every day for the first 25 days of December. The goal is to write a computer program (in any language) to solve both parts as quickly as possible.

The Advent of Code site can be found at <https://adventofcode.com/>

## How is this repository structured?

This repository is split by year, day, and part. Each year contains a folder for each day, and each day contains a txt file with my input for that day (`input.txt`) and a C++ file for each part (`part1.cpp` and `part2.cpp`). Each code file includes comments explaining each part of the code and my general thoughts on that part, including my strategy for any particularly complex parts.

## How have I done in the past?

2020 was my first year participating in AoC, and is likely to be the only one I could be even remotely competitive for. I never made the global leaderboard, but had a pretty good showing on the private leaderboard I had with some peopel I knew online.
